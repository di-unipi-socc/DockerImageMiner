## Helping your Docker images to spread based on explainable models

Docker is on the rise in today's enterprise IT. It permits shipping applications inside portable containers, which run from so-called Docker images. Docker images are distributed in public registries, which also monitor their popularity. The popularity of an image directly impacts on its usage, and hence on the potential revenues of its developers. We present a solution based on interpretable decision tree and regression trees for estimating the popularity of a given Docker image, and for understanding how to improve an image to increase its popularity. The results presented in this work can provide valuable insights to Docker developers, helping them in spreading their images.

## Explaining Successful Dockers using Pattern Mining Analysis
We present an analytical approach based on frequent pattern mining aimed at understanding how to improve an image to increase its popularity. The analysis  highlight that most of the Docker images follow rules which are very common but that do not lead to a consistent level of popularity, while some rules only used by a small portion of the images are very stable and predictive of high level of popularity both in terms of pulls and stars. Moreover, most of the maximum successful rules are followed only by images released by official repositories and this is not happening by chance.
